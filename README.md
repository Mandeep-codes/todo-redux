# ✅ Redux Todo App

A simple and minimal todo list app built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.

🛠️ I made this while learning Redux to understand how state management works in real-world React applications. It helped me get comfortable with concepts like slices, reducers, and the global store.

The app allows users to add, delete, and toggle todo items. All state is managed globally using Redux Toolkit, making it a great hands-on project for learning the Redux flow with React.
